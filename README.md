# nginx_vhost_template

This is a very basic nginx vhost template, mainly used by myself. If you want to use it replace example.com with your dowmain and change the certificate paths.

 For advanced authentification you will need to make yourself familiar with creating a root Certificate Authority and issuing client certificates.
